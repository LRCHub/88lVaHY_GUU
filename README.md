```lrc
[00:25.28] Calla lily, carnation, daisy
[00:27.82] Silently chase away your worries
[00:31.02] Chrysanthemum, kalanchoe
[00:33.68] Become your shield whenever you fall asleep
[00:36.89] I cried out
[00:39.30] Please don't leave me behind, leave me behind
[00:42.00] So you held me tight
[00:45.06] And said I will be just fine, I will be just fine, I will be just fine
[00:50.83] Petals dance for our valediction
[00:54.06] And synchronize to your frozen pulsation
[00:57.42] Take me to where your soul may live in peace
[01:00.15] Final destination
[01:03.35] Touch of your skin sympathetically brushed against
[01:05.98] The shoulders you used to embrace
[01:09.17] Sparkling ashes drift along your flames
[01:11.76] And softly merge into the sky
[01:26.26] 
[01:37.67] Lisianthus
[01:41.06] Aroma drags me out of where I was
[01:44.32] Cream rose, stargazer, iris
[01:46.71] Construct the map that helps me trace your steps
[01:49.85] Zipped my mouth
[01:52.34] I just keep climbing up, keep climbing up
[01:55.38] Justify our vows
[01:58.15] I know you are right above, you are right above, you are right above
[02:03.49] Look now
[02:07.12] I'm on the top of your world, top of your world
[02:10.48] My darling
[02:13.23] Here I come, I yell
[02:14.69] And take a leap to Hell
[02:26.19] 
[02:27.75] Swirling wind sings for our reunion
[02:32.13] And nine point eight is my acceleration
[02:35.37] Take me to where our souls may live in peace
[02:38.18] Our brand new commencement
[02:41.55] Touch of your lips compassionately pressed against
[02:44.46] The skull that you used to cherish
[02:47.36] Delicate flesh decomposes off my rotten bones
[02:49.75] And softly merge into the sky
